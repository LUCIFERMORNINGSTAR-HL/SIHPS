Reports can be divided into categories such as traffic signals, signs problems, potholes, accidents, and so on.

Data in Real Time:
Real-time updates: Real-time road safety incidents and fixes should be shown on a map interface.
Integration with traffic monitoring systems to give customers access to real-time traffic data is known as traffic information.
Emergency Services Integration: When an accident is reported, help can be dispatched right away thanks to a direct connection to emergency services.

Database: A centralized database for managing and storing all reports under data management. Include data tools
