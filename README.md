## Problem Title
Development of e-Portal for facilitating Case Management Hearing of various types of cases

## Problem Description
Case Management Hearing, known as a Pre-Trial Conference" in other jurisdictions". This application is used for managing case files since filing to disposal and to complete all its related processes. The CMS keeps the records of all the cases filed in Delhi High Court. The system has following features: Filing of Case, Caveat matching, Allocation of case, Daily Case Proceedings, Notice Generation, Case Transfer, Case Status Search, Report, etc.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Law and Justice

## Idea
The idea is to develop a robust, user-friendly e-portal that automates and streamlines the entire Case Management Hearing (CMH) process for various types of legal cases. The portal will serve as a centralized platform where all stakeholders—judges, lawyers, litigants, and court clerks—can access, manage, and update case files from filing to disposal. The system will enhance efficiency, reduce manual errors, and ensure timely updates, thereby speeding up the judicial process.

## Proposed Solution 
User Interface (UI) Design:

-A clean, intuitive UI accessible by all stakeholders with role-based access.
Dashboard views tailored for different users (e.g., judges, lawyers, clerks).
Case Filing and Tracking:

-An online case filing system that allows users to submit documents electronically.
Automatic case number assignment and real-time tracking of case status.
Automated Case Allocation:

-The system allocates cases to judges based on predefined criteria like availability and specialization.
Integration with a calendar for judges to manage their case schedules efficiently.
Case Management:

-Features like caveat matching to prevent duplicate filings.
Tools for managing daily case proceedings, including recording notes and generating notices.
Reporting and Analytics:

-A reporting module that generates customizable reports on case progress, pending cases, and workload distribution.
Analytics tools to identify bottlenecks and optimize court operations.
Security and Compliance:

-Encryption and multi-factor authentication to ensure data security.
Compliance with legal standards and data protection regulations.
Integration with Existing Systems:

-Seamless integration with the Delhi High Court’s existing Case Management System (CMS).
APIs for communication with other legal databases and law enforcement systems.
